# Chrome Extension Google Research

I am trying to build a website bookkeeper that will allow to store bookmarks in folders that are based on google searches.  Basically I want to keep track of my google searches and the related results I click on to get the answers that I am looking for. Note: There is some code that is commented out for the time being.  I will used that later on.

## Getting Started

Just fork and mess around!  

### Prerequisites

You don't need any dependencies.  Just go to the Extensions section on google chrome and select developer.  The loaded upacked and select the folder.
